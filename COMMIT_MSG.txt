feat: Add multi-source RSS support and project documentation

This commit introduces several major enhancements to the project, improving its architecture, functionality, and community-readiness.

- Refactor BBC Scraper for Multi-Source RSS:
  - The BBC scraper is refactored into a generic `fetch_rss_trends` function that accepts a URL and filename.
  - `config.py` is updated to define multiple BBC feeds (Chinese, Japanese, World News, Entertainment) as individual data sources, leveraging the new generic RSS scraper. This makes the architecture more modular and scalable.

- Add Project Documentation & Licensing:
  - Adds a `LICENSE` file (MIT License).
  - Adds a `CONTRIBUTING.md` to guide future contributors.
  - Implements bilingual `README.md` (English) and `README.zh-TW.md` (Traditional Chinese) with links for easy navigation.

- Fix Pagination Bug:
  - The pagination control in `index.html` is fixed. Changing the "items per page" selector now preserves the current page for each category, preventing the view from resetting.

- Update `.gitignore`:
  - The `GEMINI.md` log file is now ignored by Git.
